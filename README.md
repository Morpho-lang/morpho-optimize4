# morpho-optimize4

This experimental package provides a new optimizer for morpho. We expect this to replace the current optimize package in morpho 0.6.

## Installation and Prerequisites

To install the package, clone this repository onto your computer in any convenient place:

    git clone https://github.com/morpho-lang/morpho-optimize4.git

then add the location of this repository to your .morphopackages file.

    echo PACKAGEPATH >> ~/.morphopackages 

where PACKAGEPATH is the location of the git repository. 

You can then use the package in morpho as usual by including 

    import optimize4

in your code.
